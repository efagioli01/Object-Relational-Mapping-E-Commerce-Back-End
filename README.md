# Object-Relational-Mapping-E-Commerce-Back-End

## Assignemnt

For the thirteenth homework assignment in week thirteen of UNH Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp I was to modify starter code to configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Description
```
Connect the database using Sequalize, run schema and seed commands by running node seeds/index.js to create a database with test data. Open Insomnia and use localhost:3001/api/ and type either categories, products, or tags to view the data for each and use JSON to format it in the body.

```

## Built with
```
* Javascript
* Node.js
* MySql
* Express.js
* Sequelize

```

## Installation
```

You will need to clone the respositry from Github to your local machine then open up your preferred terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned the github repository.

You will need ro run in the terminal:

npm install, then open MYSQL workbench and exeute the schema, run node seeds/index.js on the root, then run node server.js on the root 

```

## Dependancis
```
dotenv
express
mysql2
sequalize
```

## Usage
```
Open Insomia and use localhost:3001/api/ to do a GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
use localhost:3001/api/products to view products
    localhost:3001/apitaggs to view tags
    localhost:3001/api/categories to view categories

Sending a GET request on the path will view all in the specified path
Sending a POST request on the path will create a new item
Sending a PUT request on the path will update an existing item
Sending a DELETE request on the path will delete the item 

```
